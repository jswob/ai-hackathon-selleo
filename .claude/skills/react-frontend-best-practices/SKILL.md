## Hard Rules

Non-negotiable conventions for this codebase.

1. **ALWAYS** use `queryOptions` factory to share query config between hooks and route loaders.
2. **ALWAYS** check Eden response `error` before using `data` — the discriminated union requires narrowing.
3. **ALWAYS** use CVA for components with 2+ variant dimensions; use cn() for simpler conditional classes.
4. **ALWAYS** prefer accessible queries (`getByRole`, `getByLabelText`) over `getByTestId` in component tests.
5. **NEVER** put business logic in route components — extract to custom hooks.
6. **NEVER** use Context for server state — use TanStack Query cache instead.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing `error` check on Eden response** — Every Eden call returns `{ data, error }`. Access `data` only after confirming `!error`. See QUERY_EDEN.md § Response Shape.

2. **Component exceeds complexity thresholds** — 300+ lines, 7+ props, 15+ lines before JSX return, 3+ useState, or 2+ useEffect are signals to refactor. See REACT.md § Component Complexity.

3. **Context for everything** — Context is dependency injection, not global state. Use TanStack Query for server state. See STATE.md § Anti-Patterns.

4. **Stale closure in query keys** — Query keys must include all reactive values used in the query function. See QUERY_EDEN.md § Query Key Factory.

5. **Using `getByTestId` first** — Prefer `getByRole` → `getByLabelText` → `getByText` → `getByTestId`. See TESTING.md § Query Priority.

6. **Manual memoization with React Compiler** — React Compiler auto-memoizes. Remove manual `useMemo`/`useCallback`/`memo` when compiler is enabled. See REACT.md § React 19 Features.

7. **Missing `zodValidator` fallback** — Search params need default values via `fallback` or schema `.default()`. See VALIDATION.md § Search Params.

8. **Vite plugin order** — `@tanstack/router-plugin` and `@tailwindcss/vite` must come BEFORE `@vitejs/plugin-react`. See ROUTING.md § Setup, STYLING.md § CSS-First Configuration.

9. **Prop drilling vs premature Context** — 1-2 levels of prop drilling is fine. Add Context only when drilling exceeds 3 levels or causes pain. See STATE.md § Decision Tree.

10. **Schema `.extend()` after `.refine()`** — Zod loses refinements on extend. Call `.extend()` first, then `.refine()`. See VALIDATION.md § Schema Composition.

11. **Testing implementation details** — Test behavior (user sees X, clicks Y, expects Z), not internal state or method calls. See TESTING.md § What to Test.

12. **Missing loader `staleTime`** — Route loaders should set `staleTime` to avoid refetching on every navigation. See QUERY_EDEN.md § Route Loader Integration.
